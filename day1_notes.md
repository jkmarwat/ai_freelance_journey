# Day 1 — Environment Setup & Python Refresh

## Date

28 Feb 2026

## Objective

Prepare a working development environment for AI automation projects and refresh essential Python skills required for API integrations and data processing.

---

# Tools Installed

### Development Environment

* Python 3.x
* Git
* Visual Studio Code

### Python Libraries

Installed using pip:

```
pip install requests pandas streamlit openai python-dotenv

```

Purpose of each library:

| Library       | Purpose                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| requests      | Interacting with APIs          |
| pandas        | Data analysis and manipulation |
| streamlit     | Building quick web apps        |
| openai        | AI model interaction           |
| python-dotenv | Managing environment variables |

# Environment Verification

Commands executed:

```
python --version
pip --version
git --version

```

All commands executed successfully confirming installation.

---

# Project Workspace Created

Main directory:

```
ai-freelance-lab

```

Structure:

```
ai-freelance-lab
│
├── projects
├── experiments
└── notes

```

Purpose:

* projects -> portfolio work
* experiments -> testing ideas
* notes -> learning documentation

---

# GitHub Repository

Repository created:

```
ai-freelance-journey

```

Purpose:

* document progress
* host projects
* build a public portfolio.

Initial files added:

* README.md
* day1_notes.md

---

# Python Concepts Reviewed

Topics refreshed today:

* Variables
* Lists
* Loops
* Functions
* Reading files
* JSON basics

These concepts are required for automation and API responses.

---

# API Test Script

File created:

```
automation_test.py

```

Purpose:
Test interaction with an external API.

Result:

* Successful request
* JSON response printed in terminal.

Learning:
Most modern applications rely heavily on APIs.

---

# Data Processing Test

File created:

```
data_test.py

```

Used pandas to analyze a small dataset.

Outcome:

* DataFrame created
* Statistical summary generated.

Insight:
Many freelance data tasks involve cleaning and analyzing small datasets.

---

# Challenges Faced

* Python path issue
* pip installation warning
* Git configuration needed.

Documenting issues would help me resolving them faster later.

---

# Key Learnings Today

1. Environment setup is critical for productivity.
2. APIs return JSON and require parsing.
3. Python libraries dramatically simplify development.

---

# Plan for Day 2

Goals:

* Connect to an AI model API
* Process a text document
* Build the first AI-powered script.

Target outcome:
A basic AI tool that reads a document and generates a response.

# Time Spent

Setup:2 hours
Learning: 1 hour
Testing: 1 hour

Total: 4 hours.

# Notes to Future Self

Consistency matters more than speed.
Small daily progress compounds into real capability.
